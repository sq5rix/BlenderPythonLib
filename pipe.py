# Creating an L-shaped pipe programmatically in Blender 
# involves several steps, including mesh editing, 
# vertex beveling, converting the mesh to a curve, 
# and then adjusting the curve's properties to give it 
# depth and resolution before finally converting it back 
# to a mesh. 
# The following function encapsulates this process:import bpy

def create_l_shaped_pipe(plane_size=2, bevel_segments=8, curve_depth=0.5, curve_resolution=4):
    """
    Creates an L-shaped pipe from a plane by deleting two adjacent edges, beveling a vertex,
    converting to a curve, and adding depth and resolution to the curve.
    
    Parameters:
    - plane_size: The size of the initial plane.
    - bevel_segments: Number of segments in the bevel.
    - curve_depth: The depth of the curve to represent the pipe's thickness.
    - curve_resolution: The resolution of the curve.

# Explanation:
# Initial Plane Creation: 
# Starts by creating a plane of the specified size.
# Edit Mode Operations: 
# Enters edit mode to delete edges and create an L-shape by beveling a vertex.Curve Conversion: Converts the edited mesh to a curve for further modification.Curve Properties: Adjusts the curve to have depth (thickness) and resolution, giving it the appearance of a pipe.Final Conversion to Mesh: Converts the curve back into a mesh and renames the object to "Pipe".Note:The deletion step has been set to remove edges, which might not directly lead to an L-shape. To ensure an L-shape, you might need to manually select and delete specific edges or vertices in Blender's UI, or adjust the deletion script logic to target specific edges based on their indices.Bevel and curve properties (bevel_segments, curve_depth, curve_resolution) can be adjusted to achieve the desired appearance for the pipe.This function provides a scripted approach to creating complex shapes in Blender, demonstrating how to combine mesh and curve operations within a single workflow.
