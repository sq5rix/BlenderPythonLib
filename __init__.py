# __init__.py for Blender Python Library Wrapper (BPL)

# The purpose of this file is to initialize the BPL package and make its modules and packages accessible for import.

# Import Python's future print function for compatibility (optional, depends on your Python version and requirements)
from __future__ import print_function

# Import necessary submodules and packages here. 
# This enables a structured access to your library's functionality.
# Example: from .module_name import ClassName, another_function

# You can also define any package-wide variables or configurations here.
# Example: DEFAULT_RENDER_ENGINE = 'CYCLES'

# Initialize any necessary configurations or perform package-level setup here.
# This can include logging setup, configuration file parsing, or other initial setup tasks.
# Example: setup_logging()

# Finally, you can include any cleanup code or package-wide utilities that should be available when using your package.

# Remember, the specific contents and structure of this __init__.py file will depend on your project's needs.
# The above examples are provided as a starting point and should be modified to fit your specific requirements.

# For more complex package initializations, consider splitting the functionality into separate modules or packages within the BPL project.
