Letâ€™s try to create an ambitious 
plugin for blender, called Swarm. 
Swarm will create a swarm of 
objects, moving between 
a set of faces. 

The animation will follow 
the schema: object will 
start from a face along 
the normal, an object origin 
will be placed on the initial 
face, object  move up to 
random height between 
min and max, 
and then move to randomly 
chosen face and land on it 
parallelly to the normal. 

The object will spend random 
time on the face and then 
repeat the takeoff and landing 

the plug in should enable a 
selection of a set of faces 
in edit mode and selection 
of initial object which 
will be animated. 

Then the object should be 
instantiated in a given 
number, which is a plugin 
parameter. 

Number of animation key frames 
is another parameter. 

The start of animation should 
be with all the object placed 
on randomly selected faces. 

At the end of the nation, 
all objects should be 
stationary on the faces. 

The objects should avoid 
collision with other objects 
both when flying, and when 
landing

The plug in parameters: 
Number of points/objects
Object 
Set of faces 
Minimum and maximum height of fly by
Minimum and maximum time spent on the face
Total number of keyframes. 
Speed of objects.
